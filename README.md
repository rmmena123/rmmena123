## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mena. Welcome to my portfolio!

### About Me

I am a passionate **front-end developer** with over 3 years of professional experience and a total of more than 5 years in the technology field. My journey in web development started at **Empresa JÃºnior IDE**, where I discovered my passion for creating and delivering impactful digital solutions. During this time, I worked on my first projects and laid the foundation for my career. Additionally, I had the opportunity to intern at **SSP-RS**, conducting in-depth analyses of criminal indicators.

Currently, I am part of the team at **Corebiz**, a leading company in e-commerce solutions, where I have been contributing for over 3 years. My expertise lies in **React**, **TypeScript**, and **VTEX IO**, and I thrive in environments that prioritize **agile methodologies** and teamwork. I have the privilege of working with **Whirlpool**, a global leader in home appliances, where I focus on enhancing the e-commerce platform of **Compra Certa**, one of its key brands.

I am committed to delivering high-quality and innovative solutions, optimizing processes, and fostering collaboration within teams. I value long-term projects and relationships, and I am always eager to embrace new challenges and professional growth opportunities.
